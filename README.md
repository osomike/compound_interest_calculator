## How It Works

### Compound Interest Formula

The calculator uses compound interest principles:

- **Principal**: Initial investment amount
- **Rate**: Annual interest rate
- **Time**: Investment duration in years
- **Contributions**: Regular additional investments
- **Compounding**: Interest calculated on principal + accumulated interest

### Calculation Logic

1. **Year 1**: Start with principal + first year contributions and interest
2. **Subsequent years**: Apply interest to accumulated balance + add new contributions
3. **Flexibility**: Different frequencies for contributions vs. compounding
4. **Safety limits**: Maximum 50 years to prevent performance issues

## Features in Detail

### Chart Visualization
- **Total Contributions**: Blue line showing cumulative contributions
- **Total Balance**: Green line with markers showing account growth
- **Legend**: Positioned below chart for clean layout
- **Interactive**: Hover for detailed values, zoom and pan capabilities

### Table Breakdown
- Year-by-year progression
- Beginning of year balance
- Yearly contributions added
- Interest earned each year
- End of year balance

### Form Persistence
- Input values are maintained after calculation
- Easy to experiment with different scenarios
- No need to re-enter all values for adjustments

## Development Notes

- Built with Flask for simplicity and ease of deployment
- Uses Plotly for interactive, professional-looking charts
- Responsive CSS design for desktop usage
- Debug mode enabled for development
- European currency formatting (‚Ç¨)
